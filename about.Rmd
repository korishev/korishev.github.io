# Morgan Nelson
![This is me](images/morgan.jpg)

I grew up in a small town in Central Wisconsin, joined the US Army in 1992 and moved to Oklahoma.  I moved to Dallas in 1997 with my wife.

I'm interested in too many things.  Most recently, I have been working with computer control wood carving and 3d printing.  I'm also working on an entry for [DIY RoboCars](https://diyrobocars.com) and looking to get involved with or start a Dallas racing chapter.  After I finish my degree

I currently work for a large, unnamed defense contractor.

I have an undergraduate degree with a double major in Computer Science and Software Engineering from UT Dallas.
